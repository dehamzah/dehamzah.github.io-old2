Hi 👋🏼

I'm a senior software engineer focused on fullstack development, platform engineering, and developer experience. I enjoy building tools and systems that empower other developers—ranging from internal platforms and cloud automation to developer portals and productivity bots. 

I’ve led initiatives to modernize tech stacks, improve CI/CD pipelines, and optimize cloud costs with smart tagging strategies. I work with technologies like JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Node.js, Flutter, and cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP), and I'm passionate about clean architecture, performance, and developer-first solutions.
